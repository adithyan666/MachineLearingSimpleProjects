This code demonstrates a machine learning workflow using TensorFlow's LinearClassifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. 
It starts by loading the Titanic training and evaluation datasets and separates the target variable (survived) from the features.
Categorical features are processed into TensorFlow-compatible formats using vocabulary lists, while numeric features are converted into numeric feature columns.
